# Booki-Project
This is a single page project that was created for a travelling agency called Booki, with the location of Marseille. 
The form at the top allows customers to edit the filters to tailor to their needs and what they want to gain from this trip, followed by a variety of accomodations and activtives to do in the city.

This is the first project that I have created, combining my knowledge in HTML and CSS while studying.
